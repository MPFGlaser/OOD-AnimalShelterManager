# OOD-AnimalShelterManager
## Purpose
This was a school assignment in semester 2 of software engineering at Fontys University of Applied Sciences.
Its goal was to make students familiar with the concepts of inhertitance when it comes to object oriented development.
In this (very simple) Windows Forms application you can add customers and different types of animals, as well as create adoptions (which link a customer and animal together). All of this data can then be saved to, or loaded from a serialised file.
